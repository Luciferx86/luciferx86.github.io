            what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data. By using Miscridex, you
            agree to
            the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

            to display Miscrit information. No personal user data is sent to or collected by this source.</p>

        <p>We also collect anonymized diagnostic, performance, and usage information through

            screen views, feature usage, and crash logs. This data does not include personally identifiable information
